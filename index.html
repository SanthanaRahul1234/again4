The virus can also cause head and neck cancer, and cancer in other parts of the body. All cervical cancers are caused by certain types of HPV.</p></div>

                <div style="padding:2%; background-color: #f3f3f3 "><p>In general, HPV is thought to handle more than 90% of anal and cervical cancers, about 70% of vaginal and vulvar cancers, and 60% of penile cancers. Cancers in the back of the throat (oropharynx) traditionally have been caused by tobacco and alcohol, but recent studies1 2 3 show that about 60% to 70% of cancers of the oropharynx may be linked to HPV. Many of these may be caused by a combination of tobacco, alcohol, and HPV.</p></div>

            <div class="col-6" style="padding:2%">
                <div style="padding:4%; background-color: #f3f3f3"><p>More than 90% of all cervical cancer cases are caused directly by HPV. For example, if there were 10,000 patients (about the seating capacity of Cameron basketball stadium at Duke University) diagnosed with cervical cancer about 9000 of these patients would have developed it due to an HPV infection. The rest of the patients may have caught it due to smoking or being chronically immunocompromised which can increase the risk of developing cervical cancer.</p></div>

                <div style=" padding:4%; background-color: #f3f3f3">HPV types are often referred to as “non-oncogenic” (wart-causing) or “oncogenic” (cancer-causing), based on whether they put a person at risk for cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer found that 13 HPV types can cause cervical cancer, and at least one of these types can cause cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and certain head and neck cancers (specifically, the oropharynx, which includes the back of the throat, base of the tongue and tonsils). The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.</div>

                <div style=" padding:2%; background-color: #f3f3f3">Also, not having routine cervical cancer screening tests (Pap tests) can mean pre-cancers are not found in time to prevent cancer. Chronic immunosuppression, such as from HIV/AIDS or other disorders of the immune system, is also associated with a higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Cervical cancer can be cured if diagnosed at an early stage and treated promptly.</div>

HPV vaccination was first recommended in 2006 and since then, infections with HPV types have dropped 88% among teen girls and 81% among young adult women. Fewer teens and young adults are getting genital warts due to the HPV vaccination. Among vaccinated women, the percentage of cervical pre-cancers has dropped by 40 percent. The protection provided by HPV vaccines lasts a long time. People who received HPV vaccines were examined for 12 years, and their protection against HPV has remained high with no evidence of decreasing over time.</div>

This vaccine is available in the UK to all children aged 11 to 13. The Bivalent vaccine also known as Cervarix and has the equivalent cancer-preventing properties as the Quadrivalent vaccine. There is also the Nonvalent vaccine also known as Gardasil 9 protects against 9 types of HPV. </div>

A small amount of lubricant may be used. </li><li>The nurse will open the speculum so they can see your cervix. </li><li>Using a soft brush, they'll take a small sample of cells from your cervix. </li><li>The nurse will close and remove the speculum and leave you to get dressed. </li><li>The cervical screening test itself should take less than 5 minutes. The whole appointment should take about 10 minutes. </li></ul>You may have some spotting or light bleeding after your cervical screening test.

We've known for many years that HPV vaccination is very effective in preventing strains of the virus, but to see the real-life impact of the vaccine has been truly rewarding. Assuming most people continue to get the HPV vaccine and go for screening, cervical cancer will become a rare disease." </h3>
